## Why is this feature needed?

Because it's our boiler plate code.

## What should the reviewer look at? (specific questions, particular files, etc)

Nothing in particular. Maybe the Webpack, server.js and index.js/app.jsx

## Share a summary of your approach (any tech/dependencies involved, tutorials that assisted you with build, AND/OR design patterns/algo strategies)

same stuff we did before.

## If you considered other solutions, why did you not implement them?

No.

## Does the build break?

Heck no, trust.
